      <p id="pleaseshowmercy">Well as you can probably tell I have fallen behind quite a bit on my assignments and I mostly blame myself, but the onslaught of midterms really got to me. I'm going back and doing all of my missing work in hopes that my merciful professor will show me pity and give me partial credit so I didn't completely mess up my whole semester in a class thats supposed to be for my major. I have messed up horribly and am literally begging for even just a little credit. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
