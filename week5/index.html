          <p id="selectors">For my MI 349 class, we have weekly assignments. For this weeks assignment, the focus was on using IDs and Classes. Along with this were are supposed to apply CSS to the various IDs and Classes that we use. I believe the purpose of this assignment was to help us learn in which situation it is appropriate to use which attribute.</p>
