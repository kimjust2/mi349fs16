        <p>The basis for this entire project is that hacktivism is just a progression of social and political activism. Merriam-Webster defines activism as “a doctrine or practice that emphasizes direct vigorous action especially in support of or opposition to one side of a controversial issue.” As you’ve seen from the background page, in the past, activists had achieved the goals of their social or political movement through various methods including protests, marches, sit-ins, and others. Hacktivism is the same as activism in theory, but where the two differ is in the methodology. Hacktivists use computers as their vehicle to attain the same results of activists who employ the methods I listed previously.</p>
