          <h2>Activism to Hacktivism</h2>
          <p>My generation, the millennials,  is exceedingly reliant on the various forms of digital media that were not accessible to my predecessors. We are now living in an era where media is being consumed in primarily digital formats on computers, phones, tablets, etc. For this project I want to examine these intergenerational differences, but with a much more narrow scope of focus. I want to look at how the Internet has changed social activism. I believe that hacktivism is just a modern form of social activism, and this website is meant to explain this evolution as well as give some examples that are relevant.</p>
