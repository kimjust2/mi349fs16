          <p>Anonymous is a hacktivist group, consisting of an international network of activists and hacktivists. Understanding who Anonymous is, and what their intentions are, is a difficult task because of the mystique surrounding the organization. There is a decentralized command structure, meaning there is no leader of Anonymous. Anyone can join Anonymous, the only requirement is an internet connection. Often believed to be a terrorist organization because of a lack of understanding, Anonymous is no different than a group of activists protesting. They have taken their protesting to the Internet. Their protests usually take the form of cyber attacks against an organization or group that Anonymous has a problem with.</p>
