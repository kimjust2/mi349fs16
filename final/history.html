          <h2>A Brief History of Social Activism and Whistleblowing</h2>
          <p>When there is a social or political problem plaguing society, there are those who step forward standing against these issues. Sometimes, the problem is well known to the public, in which case, activists who oppose these social or political issues start social or political movements whose intentional actions are meant to facilitate change. In other cases, these social and political injustices are occurring behind the scenes, without any public knowledge of the issue. Situations such as these call for a person, or group of people, to inform the public of the problem, in hopes of propagating change.</p>
          <h3>The Civil Rights Movement</h3>

          <p>The Civil Rights Movement began in the early 1900s, but gained national attention in the 1950s and 60s . It was a social movement with the primary goal of ending racial discrimination and segregation against African-Americans in the United States. There were many leaders that helped guide the movement its success, including Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Rosa Parks, just to name a few. The Civil Rights Movement was able to achieve their goals through nonviolent protests, boycotts,  and community education, among other methods. Some of the accomplishments of this movement include the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>
          <h3>The Watergate Scandal</h3>

          <p>Often, in order to shed light upon different social and political injustices, there is a whistleblower. Whistleblowing is the act of exposing these issues to the public with the hope of causing change to fix these problems. A prime example of whistleblowing in United States history would be the Watergate scandal involving Richard Nixon. In the 1970s there was a burglary at the office of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Hotel. The suspects that were caught attempting to wiretap the phones and stealing secret documents were affiliated with the re-election campaign of Nixon. President Richard Nixon took steps to cover up the scandal. The whistleblower in this case was referred to as Deep Throat. The secret informant to the reporters at The Washington Post was former FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. This scandal eventually lead to the resignation of Richard Nixon.</p>
