          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 c. all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
            <li>4 tsp. baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp. sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 c. whole milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus more for griddle</li>
            <li>3/4 lb. breakfast sausage, casings removed and shaped into 4 (3-inch) patties</li>
            <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
            <li>4 fried large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 c. baby arugula</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Whisk together milk, egg, and butter in a separate bowl. Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until just blended and smooth. Let stand 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat griddle or large nonstick skillet over medium heat; butter. Pour about ¼ cup batter for each pancake on hot griddle. Cook until puffed, tops are covered with bubbles, and edges look dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and cook until plump and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Place pancakes in a single layer on a baking sheet, and keep warm in a 175°F oven up to 30 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Wipe griddle clean with a paper towel and increase heat to medium-high. Cook sausage until no longer pink in the middle, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Top four pancakes with sausage, avocado, eggs, and arugula, dividing evenly. Top with remaining pancakes. Serve immediately.</li>
